# Blabla
Bla Bla is a simple app for anyone to write their notes, stories, memos or books in. Blabla's nature is to be a learning project for the authors to explore the latest web dev technologies. Its written using Google's Polymer on the front end. Back end will probably be some kind of combination of Python (Django, Flask? Suggestions?) or Go or Dart, Solr/ElasticSearch for indexes and some new and fancy DB to try them out. Nothing set in stone yet.
